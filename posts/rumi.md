“Your task is not to seek for love, but merely to seek and find all the barriers within yourself that you have built against it.” 


“Out beyond ideas of wrongdoing
and rightdoing there is a field.
I'll meet you there.

When the soul lies down in that grass
the world is too full to talk about.

"What you seek is seeking you"

“The minute I heard my first love story,
I started looking for you, not knowing
how blind that was.
Lovers don't finally meet somewhere.
They're in each other all along.”

“When you do things from your soul, you feel a river moving in you, a joy.”

“Forget safety.
Live where you fear to live.
Destroy your reputation.
Be notorious.”
― Rumi
