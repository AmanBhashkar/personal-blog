<strong> A Poison Tree </strong><br>
By **William Blake**<br>
I was angry with my friend;<br> 
I told my wrath, my wrath did end.<br>
I was angry with my foe: <br>
I told it not, my wrath did grow. 

And I waterd it in fears,<br>
Night & morning with my tears: <br>
And I sunned it with smiles,<br>
And with soft deceitful wiles. 

And it grew both day and night. <br>
Till it bore an apple bright. <br>
And my foe beheld it shine,<br>
And he knew that it was mine. 

And into my garden stole, <br>
When the night had veild the pole; <br>
In the morning glad I see; <br>
My foe outstretched beneath the tree.<br>
