“Trees are poems the earth writes upon the sky, We fell them down and turn them into paper,
That we may record our emptiness.” 


“Out of suffering have emerged the strongest souls; the most massive characters are seared with scars.”


“Ever has it been that love knows not its own depth until the hour of separation."


“One day you will ask me which is more important? My life or yours? I will say mine and you will walk away not knowing that you are my life.”
